[![Current Version](http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/rome)](https://crates.io/crates/rome)

**Rome** is an **RDF library** written in safe Rust.

[Documentation](https://www.vandenoever.info/rust/rome/)

# Features

- Access any data in a uniform way as RDF by implementing a Graph.
- Read/write Turtle and N-Triple files.
- Iterate over triples in graphs.
- Wrap a graph in code generated from an ontology.
- Use the type system to distinguish between blank nodes, IRIs and literals at
  compile time.

# Generated code

The ontology code is generated by these commands:

```bash
cargo run --example generate_code src/ontology ontologies/*
cargo fmt
```

# Testing

The Turtle parser passes the [W3 test suite](https://www.w3.org/2013/TurtleTests/).

Run the tests like this:

```bash
wget https://www.w3.org/2013/TurtleTests/TESTS.tar.gz
tar xf TESTS.tar.gz
cargo run --example w3tests TurtleTests/manifest.ttl
```
